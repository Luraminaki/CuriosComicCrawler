## Overview

I love `Sequential Art` from `https://www.collectedcurios.com/`. But I don't always have a stable connection (And it seems the author has some issues with his server every once in a while)... And my sight isn't as good as it used to be... So I made this... Please bear in mind that I made this for entertaining and educative purpose only. Consider supporting (financially) the author of this comic if you like his work.
Just edit the `config.json` file if you want to play around with the script...

## About The Models

As you saw in the `Requirements` section, I'm using pre-trained models. Be sure to put these in the `data/models/` folder.
